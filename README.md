##Usage

Press `Ctrl-Tab`. Press `Ctrl-Shift` if you accidentally
skipped the desired item. Selection dialog ends when you release
the `Ctrl` key.

You might also like jumping to the most recently used tab after
closing of active one. If so, you can remap your favorit "close tab" shortcut to
`:alt-tab/close-current-tab-and-go-to-previously-used` command.

##Quirks

Currently all your "AltTab dialog" shortcuts should start with `Ctrl`.

##Installation

Available in the central plugin repository.
You might need to run `Refresh plugin list`, `Reload app behaviors`
commands after installation.
